Check the JS SDK here: https://docs.commercetools.com/sdk/js-sdk-getting-started

## Config

API tokens, secrets, authentication etc are stored in `.env` file, and should not be pushed to the repo.

You can use `.env.example` to populate your API keys then save it as `.env` in the root.

## Get up and running

Requires node v.12 or up (although I switch between more recent version currently using ^18).

Install dependencies:

```
npm install
```

Run script:

```
npm run start
```
